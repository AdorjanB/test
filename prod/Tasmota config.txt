    Configuration -> Configure Other: Set "Device Name" (one word, but HA will show this field on the Dashboard) and "Friendly name".
    Configuration -> Configure MQTT: Set the "Host", "User" and "Pw".
    Console:
        Setoption19 0 (makes autodiscoverable by HA)
        TelePeriod 10 (sets the time how often tasmota checks in to HA with updated data)
