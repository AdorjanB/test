Initial setup for new Tasmota devices:
    Open the webUI of the tasmota device (its own IP address)
    Setup WiFi settings
    Configuration -> Configure Other: Set "Device Name" (one word, but HA will show this field on the Dashboard) and "Friendly name"
    Configuration -> Configure MQTT: Set the "Host", "User" and "Pw". (The user should be the one that you created in HA for the MQTT integration)
    Console:
        Setoption19 0 (makes autodiscoverable by HA)
        TelePeriod 10 (sets the time how often tasmota checks in to HA with updated data)
        Voltageset <actual voltage> (if needed to calibrate a smart electric socket)
